Canonical correlation analysis is a method for exploring the relationships between two multivariate sets of variables (vectors), all measured on the same individual. the relationships between 2 sets of variables are of interest.
Example: the relationships between the sales performance variables and the Health variables.

No need to think of one set of variables as independent and the other as dependent


U corresponds to the linear combinations from the first set of variables, X
V corresponds to the second set of variables, Y. 
Each member of U is paired with a member of V.

- canonical variate pair is (U1, V1)
- Correlation between Ui and Vj: Ro = Covariance of Ui and Vj /var_Ui/varVj
When i = j then its called Canonical correlation. 

- First canonical variate pair(U1,V1): Ro is max, varU1 = VarV1 = 1. 
Target: maximize Ro, We want to find linear combinations of the X's and linear combinations of the Y's that maximize the above correlation.

- Second canonical variate pair (U2,V2)
Constraint: U1, U1 and V1, V2 are not correlated (cov moi cap bang 0) + varu2=varv2=1


When performing CCA, data should be more observations than variables in each set.
In particular, in some research contexts like in biology or genetics with studies about gene expression, CCA cannot be performed when n ≤ max(k, m).  a standard condition usually advocated for CCA is that n ≥ m + k + 1. 



whenvariablesX1,...,Xp and/orY1,...,Yq are highly correlated, i.e. nearly collinear, matrices SX and/or SY respectively, tend to be ill-conditioned a


- Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean.
